# Library-Management-System-in-C
This Library Management System in C uses data structures to manage books and borrowers. Books are stored in a Binary Search Tree, borrowers in a Linked List, waiting lists in a Queue, and borrow history in a Stack. Librarians can add/remove books and view history, while customers can borrow, return.
